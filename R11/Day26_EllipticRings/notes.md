It really helps to have some notes from a Cryptography class you took
to help refresh you on the arithmetic of it all.

Most of my work is shown in `proof.pdf`, and Sage code in `sage_nb.html`. 

All in all, this challenge wasn't too bad, except for the constant arithmetic errors I was 
making. There weren't any proofs or algebraic 'tricks', it was mostly just straightforward
manipulation to get from one step to the next.
