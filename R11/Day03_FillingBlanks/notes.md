This was an interesting one! An introduction to pwntools and emulating C-like behaviour in Python.

The first blank is `libc`.
While it's hard to guess this from only looking above,
if you scroll further down, you can find another usage of `libc.rand()`.


The next one isn't possible to do with this script file alone,
you need to decompile `predict` and read it.
But, you can soon find that `predict` sets a seed depending on the current time,
so this one needs to be `time`.


This one is... harder.
It's not specific to the binary, but if you scroll down, 
you can see a usage of `c_int`, and guess that these need to be `c_int`s as well.


Finally, look down to the usage of `c_int` and `value` to guess that
this blank must be `value` as well.


Run the fixed file with the remote tube, and get the flag out!
