It seems like no one else did it my way :( <br>
This is why it's sad to only have a linux machine

Anyways, this is such a common game hack that you can find tutorial after tutorial 
on this on YouTube or many other sources / mediums other than myself and my markdown writeups.

Play the game. Find that after you hit a checkpoint, a wall drops and blocks you off
from viewing the entire flag.

Open up Cheat Engine. Do the usual searches, starting at an unknown float, and using the
`1 meter` markings on the ground to judge approximately how much the number changes.

Then, find a bunch of numbers that are aroung `15.5` when you're pressed against the dropped
wall. Change all of these numbers to `20`, and get teleported over the wall and into the area 
where you can read the flag :)
